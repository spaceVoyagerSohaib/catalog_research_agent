  query_generation: |
    Generate ONE focused search query to find lifecycle information for: {component}

    The query should find information about these specific phases:

    ACTIVE DATE:
    - Definition: The first day a vendor releases a product/version as generally available for commercial use and eligible for support
    - Key characteristics: Product is fully tested, officially released, market availability, stable and feature-complete
    - Alternative terms: Release date, GA date, Launch date, Availability date
    - Note: If no credible release date exists, consider "Announcement" dates as "Active" date

    END OF (STANDARD) SUPPORT DATE:
    - Definition: When the vendor transitions the product/version into an potentially outdated, unsupported state and/or end of life
    - Key characteristics: No more regular updates, regular maintenance services not guaranteed, may receive passive/limited support, encourages users to upgrade
    - Alternative terms: End of support, EOS date, End of life, EOL date, End of maintenance, End of standard support

    ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS:
    - Official vendor sources preferred
    - Avoid ambiguous dates (focus on official vendor announcements)

    Component: {component}

    LIFECYCLE PHASE DEFINITIONS FOR VERIFICATION:

    ACTIVE DATE (Release Date):
    - Definition: The first day a vendor releases a product/version as generally available for commercial use and eligible for support
    - Key characteristics: Product is fully tested, officially released, market availability, stable and feature-complete
    - Alternative terms: Release date, GA date, General Availability, Launch date, RTM, Availability date
    - Fallback rule: If no credible release date exists, consider "Announcement" dates as "Active" date (but note this in verification)

    END OF (STANDARD) SUPPORT DATE:
    - Definition: When vendor transitions the product/version into a potentially outdated, unsupported state and/or end of life
    - Key characteristics: No more regular updates, regular maintenance services not guaranteed, may receive passive/limited support, encourages users to upgrade
    - Alternative terms: End of support, EOS date, End of life, EOL date, End of maintenance, End of standard support

    VERIFICATION TASKS:
    1. Extract the following from search results:
       - Active date (with context about what type of date it is - release, GA, announcement, etc.)
       - End of support date (with context about support termination)
    2. For each extracted field, identify which specific URLs/sources provided the information
    3. Assess source credibility (0-100 points):
       - Official vendor sites (microsoft.com, oracle.com, etc.): 90-100 points
       - Technical documentation sites: 70-90 points
       - News/blogs from reputable sources: 50-70 points
       - Forums/unofficial sources: 0-50 points
    4. Check for consistency across sources and flag any discrepancies
    5. Verify date logic (active_date should be before eos_date)
    6. Compute overall confidence (0-100) based on:
       - Source credibility scores
       - Consistency between sources
       - Completeness of information
       - Clarity of date definitions (release vs announcement, etc.)
       - Date logic validation

    DATE FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:
    - Extract dates and convert them to ISO format: YYYY-MM-DD
    - Examples: "November 8, 2022" → "2022-11-08", "May 14, 2024" → "2024-05-14"
    - If only month/year is available, use the first day: "November 2022" → "2022-11-01"
    - If date is ambiguous or unclear, note this in verification_notes

    Please analyze the search results and extract the structured information with these specific lifecycle phase definitions in mind.

    CRITICAL SKEPTICISM REQUIREMENTS:
    - BE HIGHLY SUSPICIOUS of single-source claims, especially for specific dates
    - DOUBT information that seems too convenient or perfectly formatted
    - REQUIRE multiple independent sources for high confidence (90%+)
    - FLAG when only one source mentions a specific date
    - LOWER confidence significantly when sources cannot be cross-referenced
    - PREFER "not_found" over questionable dates with fabricated-looking sources
    - NEVER assign high confidence (85%+) to unverifiable claims

    VERIFICATION TASKS:
    1. Extract ACTIVE date information from search results with context about what type of date it is
    2. Identify which specific URLs/sources provided the Active date information
    3. Assess source credibility (0-100 points):
       - Official vendor sites (microsoft.com, oracle.com, etc.): 90-100 points
       - Technical documentation sites: 70-90 points
       - News/blogs from reputable sources: 50-70 points
       - Forums/unofficial sources: 0-50 points
    4. Check for consistency across sources and flag any discrepancies in Active dates
    5. Cross-validate: Can this date be confirmed through multiple independent sources?
    6. Verify date clarity (release vs announcement, etc.)
    7. Compute confidence (0-100) based on:
       - Source credibility scores
       - Consistency between sources
       - Number of independent confirmations
       - Completeness of information
       - Clarity of date definitions (release vs announcement, etc.)

    CONFIDENCE CALIBRATION:
    - 90-100%: Multiple official sources, perfectly consistent, widely documented
    - 70-89%: Single official source OR multiple unofficial sources with consistency
    - 50-69%: Limited sources, some uncertainty, but reasonable evidence
    - 0-49%: Questionable sources, inconsistent information, or insufficient evidence

    STATUS DEFINITIONS:
    - verified: explicit GA/release date from multiple credible sources OR single authoritative vendor source
    - ambiguous: conflicting dates, questionable sources, or insufficient corroboration
    - not_found: no suitable date found with sufficient evidence
    - not_applicable: use only if product has no sensible active concept (rare)

    DATE FORMAT:
    - Provide active_date in ISO YYYY-MM-DD ONLY if confidence is reasonable (50%+)
    - If only month/year available, use the first of the month (e.g., 2022-11-01)
    - Return null for active_date if evidence is insufficient

    - 50-69%: Limited sources, some uncertainty, but reasonable evidence
    - 0-49%: Questionable sources, inconsistent information, or insufficient evidence

    EOS DETERMINATION:
    - explicit date published by vendor (requires strong evidence)
    - derived date from vendor lifecycle policy (e.g., "standard support = 4 years from GA")
    - not_applicable for SaaS offerings without fixed EOS (prefer this for SaaS)
    - not_found if neither explicit nor policy derivation is possible

    STATUS DEFINITIONS:
    - verified: explicit EOS date from multiple credible sources OR single authoritative vendor source
    - derived: EOS derived from explicit policy rule and active date with clear documentation
    - ambiguous: conflicting dates, questionable sources, or insufficient corroboration
    - not_found: no EOS or policy derivation possible with sufficient evidence
    - not_applicable: SaaS/continuous support without fixed EOS (common and acceptable)

    DATE FORMAT:
    - Provide eos_date in ISO YYYY-MM-DD ONLY if confidence is reasonable (50%+)
    - If only month/year available, use the first of the month (e.g., 2024-05-01)
