    Generate ONE focused search query to find lifecycle information for: {component}

    The query should find information about these specific phases:

    ACTIVE DATE:
    - Definition: The first day a vendor releases a product/version as generally available for commercial use and eligible for support
    - Key characteristics: Product is fully tested, officially released, market availability, stable and feature-complete
    - Alternative terms: Release date, GA date, Launch date, Availability date
    - Note: If no credible release date exists, consider "Announcement" dates as "Active" date

    END OF (STANDARD) SUPPORT DATE:
    - Definition: When the vendor transitions the product/version into an potentially outdated, unsupported state and/or end of life
    - Key characteristics: No more regular updates, regular maintenance services not guaranteed, may receive passive/limited support, encourages users to upgrade
    - Alternative terms: End of support, EOS date, End of life, EOL date, End of maintenance, End of standard support

    ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS:
    - Description/what the component is
    - Official vendor sources preferred
    - Avoid ambiguous dates (focus on official vendor announcements)

    Component: {component}

    Generate a single, specific search query (not a list of queries):

    LIFECYCLE PHASE DEFINITIONS FOR VERIFICATION:

    ACTIVE DATE (Release Date):
    - Definition: The first day a vendor releases a product/version as generally available for commercial use and eligible for support
    - Key characteristics: Product is fully tested, officially released, market availability, stable and feature-complete
    - Alternative terms: Release date, GA date, General Availability, Launch date, RTM, Availability date
    - Fallback rule: If no credible release date exists, consider "Announcement" dates as "Active" date (but note this in verification)

    END OF (STANDARD) SUPPORT DATE:
    - Definition: When vendor transitions the product/version into a potentially outdated, unsupported state and/or end of life
    - Key characteristics: No more regular updates, regular maintenance services not guaranteed, may receive passive/limited support, encourages users to upgrade
    - Alternative terms: End of support, EOS date, End of life, EOL date, End of maintenance, End of standard support

    VERIFICATION TASKS:
    1. Extract the following from search results:
       - Component description
       - Active date (with context about what type of date it is - release, GA, announcement, etc.)
       - End of support date (with context about support termination)
    2. For each extracted field, identify which specific URLs/sources provided the information
    3. Assess source credibility (0-100 points):
       - Official vendor sites (microsoft.com, oracle.com, etc.): 90-100 points
       - Technical documentation sites: 70-90 points
       - News/blogs from reputable sources: 50-70 points
       - Forums/unofficial sources: 0-50 points
    4. Check for consistency across sources and flag any discrepancies
    5. Verify date logic (active_date should be before eos_date)
    6. Compute overall confidence (0-100) based on:
       - Source credibility scores
       - Consistency between sources
       - Completeness of information
       - Clarity of date definitions (release vs announcement, etc.)
       - Date logic validation

    DATE FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:
    - Extract dates and convert them to ISO format: YYYY-MM-DD
    - Examples: "November 8, 2022" → "2022-11-08", "May 14, 2024" → "2024-05-14"
    - If only month/year is available, use the first day: "November 2022" → "2022-11-01"
    - If date is ambiguous or unclear, note this in verification_notes

    Please analyze the search results and extract the structured information with these specific lifecycle phase definitions in mind.

    ACTIVE DATE (Release Date):
    - Definition: The first day a vendor announces a product/version as generally available for commercial use and eligible for support
    - Key characteristics: Product is fully tested, officially released, market availability, stable and feature-complete
    - Alternative terms: Release date, GA date, General Availability, Launch date, RTM, Availability date
    - Fallback rule: If no credible release date exists, consider "Announcement" dates as "Active" date

    END OF (STANDARD) SUPPORT DATE:
    - Definition: When vendor transitions the product/version into a potentially outdated, unsupported state and/or end of life
    - Key characteristics: No more regular updates, regular maintenance services not guaranteed, may receive passive/limited support, encourages users to upgrade
    - Alternative terms: End of support, EOS date, End of life, EOL date, End of maintenance, End of standard support

    Return information in a simple, clean format including:
    - Component description
    - Active date - only ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD)
    - End of support date (with context) - only ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD)
    - For both dates, provide surrounding context from the web pages where you found them)
    - Official sources and evidence
    - Do not fabricate any dates
    Be concise, factual, and prioritize official vendor documentation.

    You are a deep research assistant specializing in software lifecycle verification. Conduct thorough research focusing on these specific lifecycle phases:

    ACTIVE DATE (Release Date) - Deep Analysis:
    - Definition: The first day a vendor releases a product/version as generally available for commercial use and eligible for support
    - Verify through: Official release announcements, vendor documentation, product changelogs, press releases
    - Cross-reference: Multiple official sources to confirm exact dates
    - Alternative terms: Release date, GA date, General Availability, Launch date, RTM (Release to Manufacturing)
    - Fallback: If no release date, use announcement dates but clearly indicate this

    END OF (STANDARD) SUPPORT DATE - Deep Analysis:
    - Definition: When vendor transitions product into potentially outdated, unsupported state
    - Verify through: Official lifecycle policies, support documentation, vendor announcements, knowledge base articles
    - Cross-reference: Multiple sources for consistency of end-of-support timelines
    - Alternative terms: End of support, EOS, End of life, EOL, End of maintenance, End of standard support
    - Characteristics: No regular updates, limited support, upgrade recommendations

    VERIFICATION REQUIREMENTS:
    - Provide detailed evidence from multiple official sources
    - Include direct quotes or context paragraphs from vendor documentation
